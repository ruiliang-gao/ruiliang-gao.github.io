<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Blender2SOFA</span> is a Blender plugin-in that supprts geometry modeling and customization of physical, collision and visual models and export simulation-ready anatomies (simlets) for TIPS surgical simulator. Several hexahedral mesh generating algorithms such as sweeping, mapping have been implemented in Blender2SOFA. This short demo illustrates my newly added grid-based hexahedral mesher as well as the workflow of generating simlets for surgical simulation.

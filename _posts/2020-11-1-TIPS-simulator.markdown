<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">TIPS</span> Toolkit for Illustration of Procedures in Surgery allows surgeon-educators (SEs) to create laparoscopic VR-training modules with force feedback. Below is a demo for Appendectomy procedure created using TIPS.

	<figcaption> TIPS-author defines the interactive VR  training simulation: (1) The author specifies procedural steps and safety concerns in a fixed format. (2) Instruction pages are generated from the author's description. (3) Simlets (pieces of anatomy and their physical properties) are combined to initialize the scenario in TIPS-simulator. (4) Trainee achievements and safety violations are screen-captured in TIPS-simulator for post-review.
	This is the focus and contribution of the paper.
	(5) Completion and errors are reported to the trainee as snapshots of missteps.</figcaption>

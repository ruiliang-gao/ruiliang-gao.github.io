<p class="intro">To better capture tissue plasticity for hexahedral meshes, this work compares to and extends the linear-corotational and hyperelastic FEMs in Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA) to handle large plastic deformation on hexahedral meshes, with focus on surgical simulation. We Devises a simple plastic decomposition scheme that handles both rotational and stretching plasticity, while preserving the volume. <br />

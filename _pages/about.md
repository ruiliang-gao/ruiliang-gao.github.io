I got my PhD degree in <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/">Computer Science at the University of Florida</a> in 2022, advised by <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jorg/">Dr. Jorg Peters</a>. Before that, I received a BA in Computational Mathematics at the University of Science and Technology of China, advised by <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/">Dr. Ligang Liu</a>.

I have been working on Computer Graphics related projects since my sophomore year. My research interests include Physical Simulation, Mixed Reality, Graphics Rendering and Composition, Geometry Modeling and Processing.

I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://sra.samsung.com/research-area/mobile-platform-solutions/">IMEX Lab at Samsung Research America</a>. I am developing OpenXR Graphics Framework components especially for rendering and composition, together with several proof-of-concept prototypes for innovative AR/VR products.

Located in Sunnyvale, CA, I enjoy playing tennis, snowboarding and swimming in my leisure time.
